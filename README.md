Credit Risk Analysis Report
Overview of the Analysis:
The purpose of this analysis is to develop and evaluate a logistic regression model for credit risk classification. The dataset used is historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company. The goal is to build a model capable of identifying the creditworthiness of borrowers, differentiating between health loans (Class 0) and high-risk loans (Class 1). 
The Results:
•	Accuracy Score:
o	The logistic regression model achieved an impressive accuracy of 99% on the testing dataset.
•	Precision Score:
o	Precision for health loans (Class 0) was 100%, indicating that all predicted health loans were correct.
o	Precision for high-risk loans (Class 1) stood at 85%, meaning that 85% of the predicted high-risk loans were accurate.
•	Recall Score:
o	Recall for health loans was 99%, indicating the model successfully identified 91% of the actual high-risk loans.
Summary:
The logistic regression model demonstrated exceptional accuracy of 99%, showcasing precise identification of healthy (Class 0) and high-risk (Class 1) loans. With 100% precision for healthy loans and 85% for high-risk loans, the model proves effective in making accurate credit risk predictions. Continuous monitoring is recommended for adapting to evolving risk factors, but overall, the logistic regression model stands as a robust solution for credit risk assessment, contributing to more informed lending practices.
